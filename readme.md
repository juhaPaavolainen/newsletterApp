This is a very simple web app that connects to the MailChimp API and should send out a confirmation email through MailChimp once you sign up to the newsletter, althought it seems to take a good 15-20 minutes for MailChimp to actually send the email.

This web app was made as a part of the curriculum of London App Brewery's "The Complete 2020 Web Development Bootcamp" on Udemy. The main goal was to learn and practice using node.js with express, and getting and sending data through an API.
The app has been deployed on heroku and can be accessed through the url: https://strawberry-tart-41984.herokuapp.com/
